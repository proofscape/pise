# These packages are required for a working app.
# However, we do not want `pip` to automatically install their dependencies.
# These have to be listed in a separate file, because `pip` does not allow
# you to apply the `--no-deps` option on a per-requirement basis; it applies
# to a whole run, or not at all.

# Nothing here for now...
