The [PISE one-container app Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/proofscape/pise) now
uses `GremLite` instead of `RedisGraph` as its built-in graph database system.
Users of previous versions of the app will have to rebuild all Proofscape repos in their
library, as the new app will not be able to read the old graph database files.
